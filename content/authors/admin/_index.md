## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in ECE at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and the [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en), supervised by [Mark Coates](https://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/) and also working closely with [Adriana Romero-Soriano](https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor).
Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree in CS from McGill and Mila, supervised by [Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/) and [Adriana Romero-Soriano](https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor), and my B.Sc. degree in Statistics from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).

I am working in the domain of Geometric Deep Learning: graph neural networks, equivariant neural networks and their applications to recommender systems, spatial-temporal forecasting, AI4science, etc.
